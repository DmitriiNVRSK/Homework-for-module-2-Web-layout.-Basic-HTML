            Reading Like a Historian approach
            Formative assessment with Beyond the Bubble assessments
            Civic Online Reasoning curriculum
            Facilitating discussions as part of inquiry-based history instruction
            Teaching inquiry online
            Developing document-based lessons and assessments

            Feedback from recent participants in online professional development workshops: 
            “This was an absolutely excellent workshop. We need more of these! These presenters are among the best I've had in my 32+ years of teaching. Please do more!”
            “I really enjoyed participating in this class in an online format. It helped me to see how it is still possible to teach in an online format that requires students to discuss and engage with one another, and engage with documents in a meaningful way.” 
            “The whole thing was great! I really loved the modeling of strategies.”</p>
